# Quote App
This is the completed version of the quote app we worked on during our Node.js workshop on 02/03/2019. Feel free to clone and tweak around!

### How to run this locally?
- ``` npm install ```
- ```npm run dev```

### keys_dev.js needs to be created in the config folder:
```
module.exports = {
   mongoURI: 'CHANGE_ME',
   secretOrKey: 'secret'
}
```
